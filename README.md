# Hand Gesture Detection

This project focuses on detecting hand textures as an initial step toward implementing hand gesture-based control for hardware systems. The solution utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and process hand landmarks in real time. These landmarks will serve as the foundation for recognizing gestures and triggering corresponding actions in future development stages.
